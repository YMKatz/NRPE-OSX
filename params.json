Useful to install NRPE on OSX when homebrew is not available.\r\n\r\n## Download\r\n\r\n### [Download NRPE-OSX](https://github.com/tbartelmess/NRPE-OSX/releases/download/v1.0/NRPE.pkg)\r\n\r\n## Installation and setup\r\nJust download and run the installer. The installer will setup everything that is needed to run NRPE. To setup NRPE, modify /etc/nrpe.cfg.\r\n\r\n## Logging\r\nNRPE uses syslog for logging. In addition to that, launchd is configured to redirect stdout and stderr to files in /Library/Logs/nrpe\r\n\r\n## Users\r\nThe installer creates a nagios user and group, which will be used to run the NRPE daemon.\r\n\r\n## Security\r\nNRPE is launched using launchd. Launchd can't be configured to only accept connections from certain addresses. This means that you have secure NRPE yourself when the machine is exposed to a network that you are not fully trusting.\r\n\r\n## Installation location\r\n- NRPE is installed to /usr/bin/nrpe\r\n- Nagios plugins are in /usr/nagios/plugins\r\n- The NRPE configuration file is located at /etc/nrpe.cfg","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
